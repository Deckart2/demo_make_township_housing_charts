# Demo: Make Township Housing Charts
## Gabe Morrison
## February 2022

This repo serves to provide an R code sample. I wrote the only other script in the repo while serving as a Data Intern at the Cook County Assessor's Office.

The script, like other code written by the Data Team at CCAO, is open source and can be seen at the CCAO gitlab page (here)[https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling]. However, the url for the script I wrote is inconsistent. Consequently, I am creating this repo to provide a more stable link for it. 

The goal of the script was to create visualizations for changing housing trends in different Cook County townships. The code uses a variety of functions to make a 4-chart pdf summary for each town.
